I am Deepak and I have a Ph.D in Aerospace Engineering from [University of New South Wales](http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/activity2.php?activity_id=66), Australia. My research was on the investigation of hypersonic high enthalpy flows using the computational approach, in specific using [computational fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics).

A love for Python and Open Source has instigated me to start this blog and I aim to share some of the knowledge in the areas of Python, Linux, Networking, Infrastructure, Automation and many more.
