I am Deepak Ramanath and I have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from `University of New South Wales <http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/activity2.php?activity_id=66>`_, Australia. My research was on the investigation of hypersonic high enthalpy separated flows using computational techniques, more specifically using `computational fluid dynamics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics>`_. Shock/wave boundary layer interactions occurring in atmospheric entry/re-entry space vehicle configurations were examined using rearward-facing-step, compression-corners, double-wedge, leading-edge separation. Further details about this work can be found at the below-listed publications.

In recent years, I am being transitioned from carrying out computational engineering activities to IT infrastructure engineering. Partly, this is due to acquiring basic computational knowledge as a result of my background and more so with having a personal interest in development work using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, Linux, Networking, cyber-security, Infrastructure Automation using Ansible,  etc.

Hence, I'm sharing some of my knowledge via this blog in areas of Python, Linux Operating System, Networking, Infrastructure Engineering, Infrastructure Automation, and many more.
